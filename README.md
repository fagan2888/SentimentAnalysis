# SentimentAnalysis

### What does it do?
It computes the polarity of a tweet using LSTM neural networks and NLP techniques.

### How does it work?
It was trained with [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students). The model uses a LSTM network to avoid problems
when computing the gradient.

### What is the accuracy of your model?
71%, but he model has not reached overfitting yet; thus, it can be trained more.

### What is the purpose of this model?
Introduce myself to the worlds of machine learning and data science.

### Where are the models?
The models are too heavy to be uploaded. You can use your own word2vec and GloVe models, and you are free to train yourself the net.
